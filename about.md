title: About

I write about functional programming; I'm also a writer. I sometimes live-code at [livecoding.tv](https://www.livecoding.tv/averagehat/)

I'm [averagehat](https://github.com/averagehat) on github.  

I'm available for coaching, interview prep, and pair programming. [Contact me](./contact.html) if you're interested.
